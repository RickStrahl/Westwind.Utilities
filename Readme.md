### A general purpose utility and helper library for .NET development


Supports the following Targets:

* .NET 8.0,6.0
* .NET Standard 2.0
* .NET 4.62+

### Installation
You can install the package [from NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/Westwind.Utilities/) using the Visual Studio Package Manager or NuGet UI:

```
PM> install-package westwind.utilities
```

As of version 4.0 the `Data` related features are located in a separate NuGet Package:

```
PM> install-package westwind.utilities.data
```
> #### Upgrading from v3 and using Data Access Features?
> If you're switching from v3 or earlier and are using the Data Access features of the library, this is a breaking change that requires you to add the new `westwind.utilities.data` package.

### What is it?
Every .NET application requires small, common and often repeated tasks. This library is a collection of those things that I commonly need on a regular basis and have compiled over the years.

* [Get it on NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/Westwind.Utilities/)
* [Usage Documentation](https://docs.west-wind.com/westwind.utilities/_5am0u0jou.htm)
* [Class Documentation](https://docs.west-wind.com/westwind.utilities/_5am0u09dd.htm)

It includes tools for:

* [**Application Configuration**](https://docs.west-wind.com/westwind.utilities?page=_2le027umn.htm)  
class to create code-first strongly typed configuration classes for your applications

* [**Lightweight ADO.NET Data Access Layer**](https://docs.west-wind.com/westwind.utilities?=page=_3ou0v2jum.htm)  
ideal for components or apps that need data access but don't need the bulk of Entity Framework or similar ORM.  
<small>*requires adding the `westwind.utilities.data` package.*</small>
